        <h4>from a young age, I've always took stuff apart to see how it worked,
            as I got into my teen years,I took bigger stuff apart cars, engines, old washers machines,etc 
            just to see how they worked and put them back together, I love to build and work on cars and trucks and tractors out of legos,and I've always loved music growing up, I would listen to music and build legos.
            until the mp3 came out and I found ways of uploading my music off of my CD'S and on to my computer then put them on my mp3 player.  From then on I had an interest and love for computers and technology.

            <h3>
            I started having a real liking for computers and things they could do, I used to play with
            a program on an old computer called MS-dos and I give the computer commands in code and thought that was the coolest thing
            never would I ever thought I would one day be writing code and developing websites!
            </h3>
            <h3>I love taking classes here at bitwise love my classmates and the instructors and I have learned
            so many new awesome things about computers and code that I would have never otherwise.
            </h3>
 
            <h3>I will be 28 on 11-28-22, I am so blessed to share the same birthday as my dad, Which I couldn't
            ask for anyone greater to be my father, he raised me since I was three and is the only dad that I know
            He has taught me so much, most things I know I credit him for teaching me. I know some plumbing ,electrical, carpentry, welding, car mechanics,operating a tractor and a log splitter as well as a chainsaw and he even taught me how to drive,and so much more!he has been such an amazing support funding me to go through these classes. I hope to one day join a team of web devs and make awesome money.
