        <p>from a young age, I've always took stuff apart to see how it worked,
            as I got into my teen years,I took bigger stuff apart cars, engines, old washers machines, 
            just to see how they worked and put them back togther, I loved to build working cars and trucks out of legos,
            and I've always loved music growing up, I would listen to music and build legos.
            until the mp3 came out and I found ways of downloading my music off of my CD'S and on to my computer then put them on my mp3 player.

            I started having a real liking for computers and things they could do, I used to play with
            a program called MS-dos and give the computer commands and stuff that way.
            never would I ever think I would one day be writing code and developing websites!

        <p>I love taking classes here at bitwise love my classmates and the instructors and I have learned
            so many new awesome things about computers and code that I would of never otherwise.

        <p>I will be 28 on 11-28-22, I am so blessed to share the same birthday as my dad, Which I couldn't
